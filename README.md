Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using SQL — database, dimensions, measures, aggregations, and ranking insights.

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with SQL
📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using SQL. The goal is to explore raw data directly in a relational database, focusing on database structure, dimensions, measures, aggregation, and ranking analysis.

The project highlights how SQL can be used effectively for data exploration, profiling, and generating analytical insights.


## KEY EXPLORATIONS 
1. Database Exploration

  -Listing tables and relationships

  -Schema analysis (primary keys, foreign keys, data types)

  -Checking missing/NULL values and duplicates

2. Dimension Exploration

-Exploring categorical fields

  -Frequency distribution & unique value counts

  -Hierarchical dimension checks

3. Measure Exploration

  -Descriptive statistics using SQL functions (AVG(), MIN(), MAX(), STDDEV())

  -Outlier identification with conditional queries

  -Trend checks on numeric measures

4. Aggregation Analysis

  -Grouping measures by dimensions (GROUP BY)

  -Calculating KPIs (sum, average, ratios)

  -Identifying patterns and anomalies in aggregates

5. Ranking Analysis- Cumulative Analysis, Performance analysis

  -Using SQL window functions (RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), ROW_NUMBER())

  -Ranking entities like top categories, regions, or products




###📈 Insights & Outcomes

  -Clear understanding of database schema

  -Dimension and measure profiling for analytics

  -Ranking analysis to identify top contributors

  -Foundation for reporting and dashboarding
